# 👋 Hey Guys!

So this is basically the **first iteration** with the UI built. The backend is currently under development. Here's a brief rundown of the project so we're all up to speed.

## 🚀 What We've Got

**UI is done** - All 12 pages built and working with mock data. Dark mode, animations, mobile-responsive, everything.

**Live on Vercel** - [https://campus-stream.vercel.app/](https://campus-stream.vercel.app/)

**Next up** - Supabase backend for auth, database, and real-time features.

## 🛠️ Tech & Dev Style

**Stack:**
- ⚛️ React 18 + TypeScript (strict typing)
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS (utility-first)
- 🧩 shadcn/ui (copy-paste components)
- 🚦 React Router v6
- 📊 React Query
- 🔥 Supabase (coming soon)

**How We Build:**
- 📱 Mobile-first design
- 🧩 Component-driven (small, reusable)
- 🛡️ Type-safe everywhere
- ⚡ Performance-focused (lazy loading, code splitting)
- 🎯 Production mindset (error handling, loading states, edge cases)

**Code Style:**
- Clean over clever
- Descriptive names
- Hooks over classes
- TypeScript interfaces for everything
- Comments only when needed

**Project Structure:**
```

├── components/    # Reusable UI
│   └── ui/       # shadcn components
├── pages/        # Routes
├── hooks/        # Custom hooks
└── lib/          # Utils & mock data
```

## 🏃 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs at `http://localhost:8080`

## 📝 Good to Know

- Mock data in `src/lib/mockData.ts` mirrors future DB schema
- All ready for Supabase integration
- Error boundaries everywhere
- **PWA-ready** - Gonna package this as a Progressive Web App for native-like mobile experience without App Store/Play Store costs. Install straight from browser! 📲
